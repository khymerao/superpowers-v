description: Draft routing lessons from run results and let a human confirm each one — mines docs/superpowers/execution results joined with each run's manifest for repeated job-attributed failures (scope violations, failed test floors, reviewer escalations, a shared file hit by different jobs), proposes each pattern seen in ≥2 independent runs as a routing-lessons.md bullet with a fixed-menu "prefer …" action and its evidence, and writes only what the human accepts.
---

You are running **`/v:lessons`** — the human-confirmed half of the routing-lessons loop. `{{args}}` may
carry `--since YYYY-MM-DD` and/or `--min-count N`; pass them through to `draft` unchanged.

[`docs/superpowers/memory/routing-lessons.md`](../docs/superpowers/memory/routing-lessons.md) is
curated by hand and the router obeys it. Its loop — records → *a human spots a pattern* → a lesson —
stalls at the spotting step. [`scripts/compound-v-lessons.py`](../scripts/compound-v-lessons.py)
makes the spotting mechanical; **this command keeps the writing human.** No script writes that file:
you do, one bullet at a time, and only after the human says yes. Same discipline as
[`/v:adr`](v-adr.md): a litmus test, references that must exist, human confirmation, a two-command commit.

## Resolving the plugin root

The `scripts/` this command calls ship with the plugin — they are not files in your own
repository. Resolve the plugin root once per session before calling any of them:

```bash
CV="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
[ -f "$CV/scripts/compound-v-preeval.py" ] || CV="$PWD"
[ -f "$CV/scripts/compound-v-preeval.py" ] || echo "Compound V: plugin root not found (no harness substitution, and $PWD is not a Compound V checkout); set CV to the plugin directory" >&2
```

`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is set for hooks but is not set in this Bash environment. Claude Code
substitutes the plugin's path for the braced reference in the first line when it loads this
file, so that line already holds the path of the copy it loaded. Where nothing substituted it
(another harness, or this file read with the Read tool), the shell expands the unset variable to
an empty string; the second line then accepts `$PWD` only when it is a checkout of this plugin,
and the third says so on stderr instead of guessing.
Paths under `docs/superpowers/` stay relative; only the plugin's own `scripts/` get
`$CV`.

## Steps

1. **Draft (read-only).**

   ```bash
   python3 "$CV/scripts/compound-v-lessons.py" draft --repo . --json {{args}}
   ```

   It writes nothing. Each candidate carries `fingerprint`, `bullet` (the routing-lessons format with
   the literal date placeholder `YYYY-MM-DD`), `prefer` (from the fixed menu below — never your own
   wording), `evidence` (run id, job id, reason, the violated/failing files, a one-line summary),
   and `possibly_covered` / `covered_by`.

2. **None?** Say so plainly, with the numbers the draft actually scanned — `scanned.run_dirs`,
   `scanned.result_records`, `scanned.attributed_failures`, the `excluded_by_scan_failures` tally,
   and how many groups sat `below_threshold` / `unactionable` / `skipped_reviewed`. Do not lower
   `--min-count` on your own to manufacture a candidate; one bad run is noise. Stop.

3. **Litmus test, per candidate, before you show it.** A lesson must change a future routing
   decision and rest on independent runs. If the evidence is plainly one incident — every run in a
   single `-rN` chain (`evidence[].continues`), or the same deliberate probe re-run — say that next
   to the candidate so the human can weigh it. If `possibly_covered` is true, quote `covered_by`
   and say the match is a plain-text heuristic (job type AND backend named in an existing bullet).

4. **References MUST exist.** Before offering a candidate, check every cited run directory:
   `test -d docs/superpowers/execution/<run-id>` for each id in its `runs`. Drop a candidate whose
   evidence you cannot resolve and say which id failed — a lesson citing a run that is not there
   is worse than no lesson.

5. **Ask — one candidate at a time.** Show the proposed bullet, the evidence runs (run / job /
   reason / files) and the covered note. When there are **four or fewer** candidates you may instead
   present them as a numbered list and ask **as a structured choice (the AskUserQuestion tool on
   Claude Code; a plain numbered question on other harnesses)**, one question per candidate with the
   options **Accept**, **Accept with edited wording**, **Reject**, **Skip**. More than four: go one
   at a time. For each answer:

   - **Accept (optionally edited).** Replace `YYYY-MM-DD` with today's real date, apply the human's
     wording if they edited it (keep the `<job type> on <backend·model> → <outcome>; prefer <action>.`
     shape and the cited runs), and append the bullet as the LAST item of the `## Lessons` list in
     `docs/superpowers/memory/routing-lessons.md` — nowhere else in the file. Then:

     ```bash
     python3 "$CV/scripts/compound-v-lessons.py" record --repo . --fingerprint <fp> --decision accepted --note "<edited wording, if any>"
     ```

   - **Reject.** Ask for the reason in one line and record it, so the draft never proposes it again:

     ```bash
     python3 "$CV/scripts/compound-v-lessons.py" record --repo . --fingerprint <fp> --decision rejected --note "<the human's reason>"
     ```

   - **Skip.** Do nothing. It will be proposed again next time.

   **Never write the lesson file, and never run `record`, without an explicit answer from the human
   for that candidate.** There is no `--auto` and no silent path.

6. **Commit — two commands, never chained.** Only if anything was accepted or rejected:

   ```bash
   git add docs/superpowers/memory/routing-lessons.md docs/superpowers/memory/lesson-reviews.jsonl
   ```

   check its exit code, then separately:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "memory: routing lessons from /v:lessons (<n> accepted, <m> rejected)"
   ```

   Add only those two exact paths. If nothing was accepted, `routing-lessons.md` is unchanged and
   adding it is harmless; `lesson-reviews.jsonl` exists whenever anything was recorded. An uncommitted lesson is invisible to the next
   clone and to the router's other readers. Afterwards `python3 "$CV/scripts/compound-v-memory.py" refresh`
   makes it recallable through `/v:remember`.

## The prefer-action menu (fixed)

The draft proposes only these, keyed by signal. Anything else is reported `unactionable`, never
a candidate:

| Signal | Action |
|---|---|
| the same file written out of lane by different jobs in ≥N runs | move `<file>` into the serial Task 0 `shared_foundation` job |
| repeated test-floor failures for a type on a light / standard tier or a Sonnet model | route `<type>` one tier up |
| repeated reviewer escalation (`escalated_from`, `retry_exhausted`) | start `<type>` reviews at `<rung>` |
| repeated scope violations for a type or inside one lane area | force worktree isolation (when the jobs ran `direct`), else narrow the lane |

## Out of scope

This command never edits the header or the "How to add a lesson" section of routing-lessons.md,
never deletes or rewrites an existing lesson (pruning is a human edit in a PR), and never changes a
manifest or the routing policy. It proposes; the human decides; you write only what was accepted.
