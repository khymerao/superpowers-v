description: Recall relevant past Compound V context — prior decisions, failures, routing lessons, specs/plans — from docs/superpowers via V-memory (FTS5, plus semantic embeddings when bootstrapped). It surfaces EVIDENCE for planning and review, never an authority over routing. Use before planning a feature, before reviewing a diff, or any time you need "have we hit this before?".
---

You are running **`/v:remember`** — V-memory recall. The query is `{{args}}`.

**Resolving the plugin root.** The `scripts/` this command calls ship with the plugin — they are
not files in your own repository. Resolve the plugin root once per session before calling any of
them:

```bash
CV="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
[ -f "$CV/scripts/compound-v-preeval.py" ] || CV="$PWD"
[ -f "$CV/scripts/compound-v-preeval.py" ] || echo "Compound V: plugin root not found (no harness substitution, and $PWD is not a Compound V checkout); set CV to the plugin directory" >&2
```

`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is set for hooks but is not set in this Bash environment. Claude Code
substitutes the plugin's path for the braced reference in the first line when it loads this
file, so that line already holds the path of the copy it loaded. Where nothing substituted it
(another harness, or this file read with the Read tool), the shell expands the unset variable to
an empty string; the second line then accepts `$PWD` only when it is a checkout of this plugin,
and the third says so on stderr instead of guessing.

**Search in the corpus's language.** This repository's engineering prose is almost all English,
and neither lane crosses languages: FTS5 matches words, and the measured dense lane (multilingual-e5-small)
answers a Russian question with the same handful of Russian documents whatever it asks — pure-Russian
benchmark rows score 0/4 in both modes, the same questions translated to English score 2/4
(`tests/memory-queries.tsv`, 2026-09-24). So when `{{args}}` is not English, translate it to English
yourself — keep identifiers, flags, file names and error strings verbatim — and run **both** queries,
the translation first:

```
python3 "$CV/scripts/compound-v-memory.py" search "<English translation>" --top 8
python3 "$CV/scripts/compound-v-memory.py" search "{{args}}" --top 8
```

Merge the two result lists (drop repeats of the same path and heading) and say you translated. An
English query needs only the one search:

```
python3 "$CV/scripts/compound-v-memory.py" search "{{args}}" --top 8
```

Present what comes back.

A first search on a repo with no index builds one automatically.

**Tell the reader which mode answered** — lexical-only or lexical+semantic — don't let the
result stand without it: `search`'s own plain-text output names the active lane on a "Recall
mode: …" header line — surface it verbatim. If it's absent (e.g. `--json` was used), run
`python3 "$CV/scripts/compound-v-memory.py" doctor` once and read its `mode` line instead
(bootstrapped vs FTS5-only, and whether the corpus has reached the scale gate — see
[`memory.md`](../skills/compound-v/memory.md)). This matters most when the query crossed a
synonym or a language boundary and got nothing: that is expected on FTS5-only, not a bug.

**Memory is EVIDENCE, not authority:**

- It surfaces related prior prose (specs, plans, reviews, archaeology, recon, routing lessons). It **never decides routing** — backend/model/isolation stay governed by [`routing-lessons.md`](../docs/superpowers/memory/routing-lessons.md) + the scorecard, per [`routing-policy.md`](../skills/compound-v/routing-policy.md). Treat a retrieved chunk as a pointer to read, not a ruling.
- When you need a **structured** "has this file pattern repeatedly failed before?" verdict that may *auto-tighten* the next run (force worktree / add a review pass / fold into Task 0), use the deterministic bridge instead:

  ```
  python3 "$CV/scripts/compound-v-memory.py" recall-check --files <glob> [<glob>…]
  ```
