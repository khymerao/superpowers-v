description: (Re)index docs/superpowers prose into the local V-memory cache so recall is current. Incremental by file hash; runs fully offline (FTS5, pure stdlib). Optionally enable the semantic lane with a one-time bootstrap. Run it after pulling new docs, or when /v:remember looks stale.

You are running **`/v:memory-refresh`**. Args: `{{args}}`.

**Resolving the plugin root.** The `scripts/` this command calls ship with the plugin — they are
not files in your own repository. Resolve the plugin root once per session before calling any of
them:

```bash
CV="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
[ -f "$CV/scripts/compound-v-preeval.py" ] || CV="$PWD"
[ -f "$CV/scripts/compound-v-preeval.py" ] || echo "Compound V: plugin root not found (no harness substitution, and $PWD is not a Compound V checkout); set CV to the plugin directory" >&2
```

`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is set for hooks but is not set in this Bash environment. Claude Code
substitutes the plugin's path for the braced reference in the first line when it loads this
file, so that line already holds the path of the copy it loaded. Where nothing substituted it
(another harness, or this file read with the Read tool), the shell expands the unset variable to
an empty string; the second line then accepts `$PWD` only when it is a checkout of this plugin,
and the third says so on stderr instead of guessing.

**Default — offline, FTS5, no install, no network:**

```
python3 "$CV/scripts/compound-v-memory.py" refresh
python3 "$CV/scripts/compound-v-memory.py" doctor
```

Report the `doctor` summary (files / chunks / staleness / whether embeddings are bootstrapped).

**Semantic lane (opt-in).** Embeddings are OFF by default and live **outside the repo**
(`~/.cache/compound-v/memory/<repo-id>/`). Enabling them is the **only** step that touches
the network — and it must be explicit, never from a hook:

```
python3 "$CV/scripts/compound-v-memory.py" bootstrap                 # creates the out-of-repo venv + model (one time)
python3 "$CV/scripts/compound-v-memory.py" refresh --with-embeddings # populate vectors
```

If the project opted into embeddings at [`/v:init`](v-init.md) (`memory.embeddings: true` in
`.claude/compound-v.json`), the engine **already** adds vectors on a plain `refresh` once
bootstrapped — you don't need the flag. If `{{args}}` asks for `--with-embeddings` and
`doctor` shows embeddings are not bootstrapped, run `bootstrap` first (tell the user it will
download a ~200 MB model once).

**`--with-embeddings` only does something once ALL THREE conditions hold** — say this plainly
if `doctor` shows the dense lane inactive after a refresh:

1. `bootstrap` has completed (out-of-repo venv present);
2. `.claude/compound-v.json` has `memory.embeddings: true` (set at [`/v:init`](v-init.md) Step
   3b, or by hand); and
3. the corpus has reached the scale gate (a minimum vector count — dense stays dormant,
   FTS5-only, below it, deliberately: on a handful of docs a full read or FTS5 already wins).

`doctor`'s own `mode` line reports exactly which of the three is missing in plain language (e.g.
"dense venv installed but disabled", "dense enabled but not bootstrapped", "below the scale
gate (N vectors < gate)") — read that line rather than re-deriving the state from the other
fields. Any one of the three missing ⇒ FTS5-only, silently and correctly. This is also the shape
of the most common confusion: bootstrapped-but-not-configured (condition 2 missing) looks
identical to "nothing happened" from the outside — the `mode` line is what tells them apart. See
[`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](../TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for that failure mode written out.

The semantic lane is **scale-gated**: it only changes ranking once the corpus is large
enough to matter; on a small corpus FTS5 already wins. If bootstrap fails (offline / no
wheels), the engine stays FTS5-only — recall still works. See
[`skills/compound-v/memory.md`](../skills/compound-v/memory.md).
