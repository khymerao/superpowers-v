Compound V — emit the Phase 1 pre-flight as a NATIVE WORKFLOW.

WHAT THIS IS
------------
Phase 1 runs three independent auditors against one spec:

    1A  code-archaeologist   what the existing CODE actually does
    1B  domain-expert        what the DOMAIN and its regulators actually require
    1C  doc-validator        what the LIBRARIES actually are, today

They have always run in parallel. They ran as three separate `Task` calls, which
means the developer watching sees three opaque spawns, no phase grouping, no
progress tree, no shared budget ceiling, and no structured result — the same
"we built our own instead of using the native one" pattern this release line has
been closing everywhere else. `parallel()` inside a Workflow gives all four for
free, and `agentType` spawns each auditor BY ROLE so it arrives with its own
definition rather than a re-pasted prompt.

WHY `parallel()` AND NOT `pipeline()`
-------------------------------------
The house rule is pipeline-by-default, and this is the documented exception: the
brainstorm cannot continue until it has ALL THREE audits, so the barrier is real
rather than incidental. There is no second stage to overlap with.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
--------------------------------
  * NO `bashCommandClamp`. Dogfood 24 watched a clamped agent get its own
    documented first step denied. An auditor greps, reads, runs `git log`, and
    queries the recall layer; a clamp here would break the audit the same way.
  * NO removal of the NETWORK. The Implement stage denies WebFetch/WebSearch on
    purpose — research belongs to a PRE-FLIGHT, and this IS the pre-flight.
    `domain-expert` and `doc-validator` are network-dependent by definition (4 and
    6 references respectively in their own files).

    That is NOT the same as "no narrowing at all", and the first version of this
    file conflated the two. A cross-model review called it HIGH: with no
    `disallowedTools` an auditor could run arbitrary commands, rewrite any file in
    the repository and spawn further agents, while this docstring claimed it
    "writes ONE document into its own directory". `agentType` selects instructions;
    it enforces nothing.

    So the narrowing is now the OPPOSITE selection from Implement's: the network
    stays, and the authority to mutate anything beyond the audit goes. `Task` and
    `Agent` go because an auditor that spawns is no longer an auditor; `Bash` goes
    because nothing in these three definitions needs a shell that `Grep`, `Glob`
    and `Read` do not already give — with a short allowlist, admitted through a
    clamp: the recall query and read-only git history (log/blame/show).
  * NO isolation. An auditor writes ONE document into its own directory and reads
    everything else; a worktree would only hide the repository it exists to read.
  * NO routing decisions. These produce evidence. Backend, tier and isolation for
    the eventual jobs stay with `routing-policy.md`, deterministic and untouched.

MODEL
-----
Each agent's own frontmatter decides: `code-archaeologist` and `doc-validator` are
`sonnet` (scanning and version-checking are execution), `domain-expert` is `opus`
(domain judgment). This script passes NO `model`, so the definitions win — the one
place where not wiring something is the correct choice.

# RECALL AT EMIT TIME — the pre-flight half (v3.7.2).
#
# Every auditor definition opens with a Step 0 that ASKS it to run the V-memory
# search. That is prose, and prose is skippable: the 2026-09-24 audit counted 369
# real `search` calls and about 1% of their results visibly used. This emitter
# already writes every auditor's prompt, so it runs the search ONCE, here, and
# hands each auditor the result as a block of its prompt — deterministic, and
# testable without a model. Step 0 stays in the definitions as the FALLBACK for a
# prompt that carries no block (engine absent, index missing, a run by hand).
#
# NEVER BLOCKS THE EMIT. A missing engine, a missing index, a non-zero exit, a
# non-JSON answer or a slow one records `recall: unavailable (<reason>)` on the
# plan and the pre-flight is emitted without the block. A recall layer that can
# stop a pre-flight is a new single point of failure for no gain.
#
# RECALLED TEXT IS UNTRUSTED DATA. Anyone who can edit docs/superpowers/** writes
# it. So every field is collapsed to ONE line (a snippet can never open a heading
# or a list item of its own), quoted, length-capped, and the block is framed and
# closed by an explicit end line, with the framing sentence saying so.
